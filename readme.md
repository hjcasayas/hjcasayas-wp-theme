# Henly Jade Casayas
I am a software engineer and among the self-taught ones. I love and enjoy coding/programming to the extent of leaving my electrical engineering job. I will continue to learn, enjoy, and be amazed like the first time I fell in love with it. I am doing development challenges in my free time. You can check them in my [portfolio website](https://hjcasayas.info).
